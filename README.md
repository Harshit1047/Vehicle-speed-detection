# Vehicle Speed Detection

The speed detection of vehicles plays a key role for safety of civilian lives which prevents many mishaps. This project plays a vital role in monitoring vehicle speed. Here,we propose different methods consists of background subtraction, feature extraction. In which,speed is determined by using distance travelled by vehicle over number of frames and frame rate.
